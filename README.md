# About ePlaces

ePlaces is a modern Web Application (powered by various APIs) writen in JavaScript where users can find places to eat, drink, shop or have fun in any city around the world.

# APIs used to build the App

- [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) (main api in the project) : is one of the the best Places API that gives developers access to thousand places data around the world.
- [Ajax Autocomplete List Cities JSON-P API](http://geobytes.com/free-ajax-cities-jsonp-api/) : is one of Geobytesâ€™ web services that gives developers access to all cities worldwide. Did I mentioned it ? **It's free**.
